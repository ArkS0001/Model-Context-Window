1. Architectural Changes

    Sparse / Structured Attention

        Sliding-window + global tokens (e.g. Longformer): each token attends to w neighbors plus a handful of “global” positions (like [CLS]) for long-range flow.

        Block-sparse (“BigBird” style): combine local windows, a few random connections, and global tokens to approximate full attention in O(N) time.

        Learned sparsity (e.g. Routing Transformer): dynamically select a subset of keys per query based on learned routing.

    Recurrence & Memory

        Segment-level recurrence (Transformer-XL): cache K/V from past segments and reuse them, coupled with relative positions to span effectively unlimited length.

        Compressive memory (Compressive Transformer, Melodi): push older memories into a smaller “compressed” buffer so you never store all past states at full resolution.

        Memory tokens (Recurrent Memory Transformer): reserve a small set of tokens that persist and get updated each segment, carrying global summary forward.

    Hybrid Local + State

        Split text into fixed-size blocks (e.g. 2 K tokens), do full attention within each block, then use a tiny MLP or RNN to compress each block into a state vector that gets prepended to the next block. This gives constant memory growth—your model only ever holds one block + a small state.

2. Positional Encoding for Longer Sequences

    Relative encodings (Transformer-XL style or T5’s bias): distances are baked into attention scores rather than absolute embeddings, so concatenating segments doesn’t confuse the model.

    ALiBi (linear distance biases): no extra parameters—just subtract a linearly increasing penalty for distance, which empirically extrapolates to much longer inputs.

    Rotary embeddings + interpolation (RoPE, YaRN): rotate Q/K vectors by layer-wise phases, then adjust (interpolate or rescale) those frequencies when moving from, say, 2 K→100 K tokens.

3. Training & Fine-Tuning Techniques

    Long-sequence fine-tuning

        Simply continue pretraining (or LoRA‐style adapter tuning) your base model on longer sequences, perhaps with a sparse attention pattern during training (e.g. LongLoRA) to reduce compute.

        Curriculum: gradually increase sequence length during training so the model “grows into” using longer context.

    Token compression / semantic summarization

        Pre-process long documents through a smaller “compression” network that condenses each chunk into a fixed-size embedding or summary tokens, then feed only those into the main model. This doesn’t increase raw window size, but effectively extends how much content you can handle end-to-end.

    Memory-augmented adapters

        Train lightweight adapters (e.g. LoRA, Prefix-tuning) that specialize in managing a recurrence buffer or compressed memory, leaving the main model untouched.

4. Engineering & Inference Optimizations

    FlashAttention2 & XFormers: use highly optimized kernels that support block-sparse or sliding-window attention.

    KV-cache pruning: if you know only certain layers or heads carry distant info, you can drop old keys/values after they’re “summarized.”

    Sequence-parallel / tensor-parallel training: distribute very long sequences across GPUs to handle memory demands.

    Gradient checkpointing: trade compute for memory during fine-tuning on long inputs.

5. Trade-Offs & Best Practices

    Compute & latency rise roughly linearly with sequence length, even for sparse methods.

    Information loss: any compression or sparsity may drop fine details—tune your sparsity window vs. global tokens trade-off.

    Data scarcity: you’ll need a corpus of genuinely long texts (books, codebases, transcripts) to teach the model to use the extra window, otherwise it may ignore distant tokens.

Recommended Recipe

    Pick a sparsiﬁcation or memory mechanism that fits your use case:

        If you need all-pairs within a medium-long window (e.g. 100 K tokens), go with BigBird/Longformer style.

        If you need unbounded history (e.g. streaming transcripts), use Transformer-XL or Compressive Transformer.

    Adopt a relative/ALiBi positional scheme so you can safely push beyond your training length.

    Fine-tune your chosen base (e.g. Llama-2/3, Mistral) on longer sequences, perhaps via LoRA plus a sparse-attention proxy (LongLoRA) to reduce GPU needs.

    Validate on held-out long-context tasks (book QA, multi-document summarization) and iteratively adjust your local/global window sizes or memory-compression ratio.
